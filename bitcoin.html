      <h2>Project intent</h2>
      <p class="small prose">
        The primary goal of this project was to stay deeply engaged while exploring modern deep learning approaches for
        time series. Bitcoin was chosen because it is a highly dynamic, non-stationary signal that makes model behavior
        and failure modes easy to observe. The emphasis is on understanding modeling choices (targets, windows, features,
        and recency bias) rather than claiming an optimized trading system.

      <h2>What I built</h2>
      <p class="small prose">
        • Implemented a live-compatible data pipeline using hourly market data and a consistent timestamped dataset.<br>
        • Engineered predictive signals including returns, rolling volatility, momentum, and RSI/MACD-style indicators.<br>
        • Structured the learning problem as short-horizon <strong>returns forecasting</strong> (1–3 hours ahead) to reduce “copy last price” behavior.<br>
        • Experimented with sequence-model training setups (lookback windows, normalization choices, and recency emphasis) to study trend sensitivity.<br>
        • Tracked model behavior with diagnostic plots and error patterns to understand when and why predictions drift.

      <h2>What I learned</h2>
      <p class="small prose">
        This project highlighted how easily time-series models can default to naive behavior if the target and setup are
        not designed carefully. Framing prediction as returns, using meaningful features, and emphasizing recent context
        helps models express trend sensitivity. It also reinforced the reality of non-stationarity: strong results require
        careful evaluation design, stability checks across regimes, and honest baselines.
